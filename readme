What is your mywc program test plan?

We created several tests to check that our code works as expected.
Boundary tests:
mywcEmpty.txt - an empty file. Ensures that all counts are 0 in the
case of an empty input file.

mywcJustLetters.txt - a string of letters with no spaces or newlines.
Ensures that the word count is 1 and the newline count is 0 for when no
spaces or newline characters have been read.

mywcJustSpaces.txt - 15 spaces. Ensures that our code works for more than
one space in a row, and that the word count is 0 (doesn't increment) when
more space characters have been read (no matter how many in a row).

mywcJustNewlines.txt - 15 newline characters. Ensures that our code counts
newline characters, and that the word count is 0 (doesn't increment) when
more newline characters are read (no matter how many in a row).

Statement tests:


Stress tests:
mywcLong.txt - a long excerpt from Sherlock Holmes containing a random
assortment of characters - letters, spaces, newlines, etc. Tests that
our code works for long input files.

mywcLong.txt - an even longer excerpt from Sherlock Holmes containing
a random assortment of characters - letters, spaces, newlines, etc.
Tests that our code works for very long input files.
